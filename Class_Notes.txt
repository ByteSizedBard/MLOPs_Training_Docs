		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Production 
		
		- Monitoring/Maintain
		
		
	Waterfall Model : 
		- Linear in fashion - Follow top-down approach 
		- Meant for Monolith Application Architecture 
				- Monolith Applications are Tightly Coupled Applications
		
	
	Desktop Applications  :::

	Using AGILE Methodologies :
	
		We can able to achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			- Continuous Integration 
			- Continuous Testing 		
			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.
				
			
		We cannot achieve:		
			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

				
	
	DevOps :
	
		DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployments and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
		Shift Left Approach! - DevSecOps
		
		Dev -> Test -> Production
		
		
		Development Teams' Workload :
		
			- New Project 
			
			- Enhancement Projects / Bug Fixing 
			
		Parallel development :::
		
			- Achieved using Git Branching stragies 
			
			
		How to Implement DevOps ???						<======>   				MLOps
		
		
		- Identify the Teams :

			Devops Team :
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
						20+ Test Servers - Provision & Configure
							-> IAC Tools - Terraform/Ansible						
				- App Development Team 
				- Testing Teams 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 
				
				
		- Application Architecture :
			
			- Monolith Application Architecture :::
				- Monolith Applications are Tightly Coupled Applications
				- All the Functions/dependencies are created, tested, and deployed as whole Application
				- We can achieve Continuous Delivery. Not Continuous Deployment
				
			
			- Micro-Service Based Architecture :::
			
				- It is a loosely coupled Application Architecture
				- Whole Application is divided into Micro-Services 
				- Continuous Deployment can be achieved only using Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				
		Continuous Delivery :

			- Continuous Delivery ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it expects the manual approvals for production releases.

					Core Banking Applications / Insurance Applications ::::
					
						-> On-Prem Infra-Structure
						
						-> Cloud Infra-Structure
						
						-> Downtime?				
			

			- Continuous Deployments ::
				- It is a process used to release the changes to production environment, and it never expects any manual approvals/intervension for production releases.

				- Continuous Deployments can be achieved based on the Application Architecture.
					- Application Architecture should be Micro-Service Based Application Architecture.

	MLOps : Stands for Machine Learning Operations	
		
	MLOps is a core fn of Machine Learning Engineers - to Streamline the process of taking the ML Models from dev to prod and also maintain and monitor ML Models 
	
	MLOps is collaborative effort of Teams like Data Scientists, DevOps, IT.
	
	
	What is Machine Learning?
		- A technique by which a computer can learn from data without using a complex set of rules, Mainly based on training a model from the Huge Datasets..
	

Use Cases of ML Projects :::	
	Retail Domain :
	
		E_Commerce 
		
		
	Logistics :
	
	Stock Market 
	
	Doller rate 
	
	Gold Rates 
	
	Weather reports 
	
	Reviews 
	
		amazon.com 
			- 
			
	Openai
	
	What is the need for MLOps?	
	
		Address all the practical challenges of ML Projects: 
		
			- ML Model creation at enterprise level :
				- Dependencies
				- Multiple Teams Involved in the process 
				- Risk associated with each team and dependent systems 
				- Infra-Structure - Auto Scaling and Load Balancing 
				
	How to Implement MLOps :
	
	- Data Engineers		-> Prepare the Source Data sets 
	
	- Data Scientists 		->  Explore the datasets, analyse, check the feasibility of datasets 
								Perform the training, tuning, and evaluate the Model
	
	- ML Engineers 			-> Deploy the ML Models to prod -> MLOps Strageies CICD, define best practises
								Should have MLOps Knowledge
	
	- Business Stakeholders --> Bring business values using this ML Models 
	
	- Data Security/Governance Team  --> To Ensure data security & Governance, data privacy
	
	
	DevOps can be used to automate the typical Software Application Build and Deployments using CICD Pipelines 
	
		- E_Commerce Application
		- Desktops Applications
		
	MLOPs - Is predominantly used to automate the deployments of ML Models/Project
		
		- Chatbot 
			
			
	Process/Lifecycle of Machine Learning Ops:::
	
		- Data Preparation 

		- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
		
		- Feature Engineering
		
		- Model Training 
		
		- Model Validations 
		
		- Model Deployment 
		
		- Monitoring
